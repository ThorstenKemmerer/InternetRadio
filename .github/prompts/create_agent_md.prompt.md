Create an AGENT.md for this repository that explains:
- what this repo is
- how to set up the dev environment
- how to run tests and lint
- coding standards (formatting, naming)
- PR/commit expectations
- release process (if any)
- where configs live (CI, tooling)
Keep it concise and practical.
Ask me questions if anything is unknown.
